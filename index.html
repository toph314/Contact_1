  <h1>The Whale Tale</h1>
  <img src="whale_print.png" alt="Woodcut of whale and ship">

  <div class="limerick">
    A sailor from old Nantucket<br>
    Said, "Harpoons? Nah, I chucked it."<br>
    He met with a whale<br>
    Who flipped up his tail—<br>
    And swam off with all of his bucket.
  </div>

  <div class="limerick">
    The captain then cried with a yelp,<br>
    “That whale won’t respond to my help!”<br>
    The ship gave a lurch,<br>
    The crew screamed “Research!”<br>
    And blamed it on climate and kelp.
  </div>

  <div class="limerick">
    A gull flew above with a squawk,<br>
    And offered to barter or talk.<br>
    He said with a grin,<br>
    “You’ll never win—<br>
    That whale’s got the strength of a rock.”
  </div>

  <div class="limerick">
    So now when you sail with your mates,<br>
    Beware of the ocean’s debates.<br>
    A whale with a grudge<br>
    Will never just budge—<br>
    He’ll ghost you for nautical fates.
  </div>
